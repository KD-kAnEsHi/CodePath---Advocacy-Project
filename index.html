      <h2>The PolTech Manifesto</h2>
      <p>To address the low voter amongs teenagers between the age of 18 to 29 years old and the low Income individuals
        in local, state, and federal elections. Young Americans, have consistently shown lower voter turnout compared to
        older age groups, especailly when it comes to local elections despite the fact that local election arguiably
        impacts us and our society more than the federal elections. This sharp gape is due to the fact that young voters
        often face obstacles such as complex voter registration rules, lack of information on where and how to vote, and
        challenges in navigating the voting process. This can lead to a lack of follow-through despite their interest
        and intentions to participat in the elections. This is where PolTech comes in. We are a group of young voters
        who are dedicate to inspire young Americans and low-income individuals to actively participate in shaping their
        future through the democratic process. Together, we aim to break down the barriers that hinder voter engagement,
        promoting a more inclusive and representative democracy for all. Join us in making a difference, one vote at a
        time.</p>
